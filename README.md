# CSGO V2
This is my CSGO Educational internal Cheat, which is a recode of my old version (shitty hazedumper offsets based), hence why its called "V2"
---
Still missing alot of features, the base is still being built. after that more features will be added in the feature.
its named "cockbalt" after the cheat "[cobalt.solutions](https://cobalt.solutions/)" as a meme.

# ToDo's
There are alot of ToDo's atm but i will mention one thing.
1. Clean and orginize code. some of my code is messy and made for testing and debuging purposes, needs orginization and cleaning. a big example of this is the menu code. will need new code to render the tabs with clean code, which is why the UI.cpp/.h files were made.
1. Sleep.
